## How It Works

### Adding a Section Component (e.g., ContactSection.vue)

To add a new section, you need to create a corresponding Vue component (e.g., `ContactSection.vue`) and manage its data using the JSON configuration file. Here's how to do it step-by-step:

1. **Create the Component:**

   Create a new Vue component in your `components` folder. For example, `ContactSection.vue`

2. **Define the Section in the JSON File:**
   Next, define the new section in your portfolio-data.json file. This is where you can manage the content of each section.

```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "Home",
      "path": "home",
      "component": "HomeSection",
      "pageTitle": "John Doe | Web Developer & Designer"
    },
    {
      "name": "About",
      "path": "about",
      "component": "AboutSection",
      "pageTitle": "About Me | John Doe"
    },
    {
      "name": "Projects",
      "path": "projects",
      "component": "ProjectsSection",
      "pageTitle": "Projects | John Doe"
    },
    {
      "name": "Contact",
      "path": "contacts",
      "component": "ContactSection",
      "pageTitle": "Contact Me | John Doe"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Vue.js provide/inject Pattern

We leverage Vue's `provide/inject` pattern to make the section data accessible to child components without the need to pass props down multiple levels. This pattern is particularly useful for managing shared state across components.

For example, take a look at the `contactSection` variable in the `HomeSection.vue` component:

```js
const sections = inject("sections");
const contactSection = computed(() =>
  sections.find((section) => section.name === "Contact")
);
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-template.git
   cd portfolio-template/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Deploy: After building, the production-ready files can be found in the `dist` folder. Deploy these to your preferred web hosting service.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

You have two options for deploying to GitHub Pages:

#### Option 1: Using the Deployment Script

1. Run the deployment script from the root of the project:

   ```bash
   ./deploy_gh_pages.sh
   ```

2. Configure GitHub Pages settings:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Under "Build and deployment", select `gh-pages` branch
   - Click Save

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

For step-by-step instructions on manually deploying your Vue.js project to GitHub Pages, please refer to the official Vue.js documentation: [Vue CLI - Deployment to GitHub Pages](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#github-pages)

## Customization

### Adding/Removing Sections

To add or remove sections, edit the `portfolio.json` file located in the root of the project. Add a new section object or remove an existing one. Each section requires a name, path, component, and content.

### Localization (TODO)

The template currently supports English content. To extend this to other languages:

1. Implement a localization system (e.g., Vue I18n).
2. Store localized strings in JSON files or other formats.
3. Modify components to dynamically load the appropriate language based on user preferences or browser settings.

## Dependencies

- [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/): A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/): A flexible and customizable icon library.
